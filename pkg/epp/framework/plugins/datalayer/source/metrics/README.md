# Metrics Data Source

**Type:** `metrics-data-source`

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin is enabled by default together with `core-metrics-extractor`. You do not need to explicitly declare it in your configuration, but it can be disabled if metrics collection is unnecessary.

The Metrics Data Source is a data layer plugin that polls a Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint of a model server and parses the response into a structured format for extraction.

## What it does

1.  Periodically (or when triggered) performs an HTTP GET request to a configured metrics endpoint (e.g., `http://<endpoint-ip>:8080/metrics`).
2.  Parses the Prometheus text format response into a `PrometheusMetricMap`.
3.  Provides the parsed metrics to any registered extractors (like the `core-metrics-extractor`).

## Outputs produced

-   `PrometheusMetricType`: A map where keys are metric names and values are Prometheus `MetricFamily` objects.

## Configuration

The plugin config supports:

-   `scheme` (default "http"): The protocol scheme to use for metrics retrieval.
-   `path` (default "/metrics"): The URL path to use for metrics retrieval.
-   `query` (map, optional): URL query parameters added to each scrape request.
-   `insecureSkipVerify` (default true): Whether to skip TLS certificate verification when using the "https" scheme.
-   `caCertPath`: PEM CA bundle to verify the target's server cert.
-   `clientCertPath` / `clientKeyPath`: client certificate for mTLS. Set both together.
-   `interval` (string, optional): Scrape period (e.g. `"1s"`). Rounded to the nearest
    multiple of `--refresh-metrics-interval` (default 50ms). Omit to scrape every
    base tick.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
type: metrics-data-source
parameters:
  scheme: "http"
  path: "/v1/loads"
  query:
    format: "prometheus"
    include: "core"
  insecureSkipVerify: true
  interval: "1s"
```

## Multi-cluster support

`multicluster-metrics-data-source` is the cluster-scoped variant. It scrapes a peer cluster's metrics like the pod source, and a distinct type lets a config pair it with `multicluster-metrics-extractor` independently of the pod pipeline. Because it crosses a cluster trust boundary it verifies the peer certificate by default, unlike the pod source. Set a `caCertPath` for a private cluster CA, or `insecureSkipVerify` to opt out. The response payload is size-capped. See the [wiring example](../../../README.md#example).
